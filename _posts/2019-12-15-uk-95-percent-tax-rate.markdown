The UK income tax system has some real oddities hidden in around. One is that you lose your tax free allowance
(currently £12.5k) as you earn over a certain amount. Currently you lose £1 for every £2 you earn over £100k. So by the
time you earn £125k you’ve lost it all. 

This means that the money you earn between £100k and £125k is taxed at 60%! This is made up of the original 40% and the
40% tax you pay on the £12.5k that would otherwise have been tax free.

So if you get offered a pay rise of when you earn £100k should you reject it? Of course not as you still get to keep the
40%. However, if you have the opportunity to do extra work or take on additional responsibility that will push you over
£100k then consider it wisely as your additional take home pay may not be worth the extra effort and time away from
family and hobbies. 

If you’re earning between £100k to £150k I’d recommend using your full pension allowance to avoid this crazily high tax
rate.  Currently you can put £40k a year into a pension. This is a huge amount for most people but those focussing on FI
typically have a much higher savings rate than average and may be putting the full £40k in.

The next oddity is pension allowance tapering. Pension tapering reduces your pension allowance by £1 for every £2 you earn over
£150k. Let’s look at a case study at how these two oddities can interact for a fictitious FI seeker named Bella.

Bella has a nice job, she earns 150k. Because she wants to retire before 57 she does not pay into a pension and takes
home: £90k.

She soon learns the error of her ways as she realises she needs money after 57 even if it's a long way off and given she
lives off a small amount she expects an effective tax rate for her pension pot to be 10% (a separate article will be on
how to calculate this). 

She starts paying 40k a year into her pension. Paying in 40k to the pension gets back 7.5k of the tax free allowance.
Her new take home pay is £70k, down 2£0k, but now 40k in a pension of which she’ll get £36k back after 57. 

Her total income (take home + pension after tax) is £106k. Her savings just went up by £16k a year even when taking into
account tax on the pension on the way out.

Now Bella gets offered some new work for another £10k a year, bringing her earnings to £160k. This has two bad side
effects:
* Her pension limit has been reduced to £35k
* She loses more of her tax free allowance and can’t reclaim it with pension contributions

Her take home becomes £75k, up £5k, and she can now only put £35k into the pension which becomes £31.5k when taken out. 
This results in a total income of £106.5k. 

Hold on a moment! That is only an extra £500 for an additional £10k income, that is a 95% tax rate!

How is this so? It is due to the £10k being taxed at 60% due to the £100k-£125k tax allowance removal along with the
loss of the 40% tax relief on the reduced pension allowance.

This is so extreme as Bella is a high earner but is very frugal. Most high earners that get higher rate tax relief on
pension contributions also extract a lot in retirement meaning part of their pension withdrawals are taxed at 20/40%. Where as Bella can live off
£10-20k a year, most of which will be tax free in retirement.

So if you’re a high earner that intends to retire on a small income like many of us in the FIRE community, think again
before taking your income over £150k if it involves any extra work. It nearly pays you nothing!
