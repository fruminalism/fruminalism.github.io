In our last post we shared our [annual expenses](https://fruminalism.github.io/blog/whats-our-fi-number/). They are
roughly £20k on the mortgage and £20k on other stuff which means our FI number is £1.2M but if we had no mortgage we’d
only need £600k (which we’re very close to).

We live in London, an expensive town. We have a house worth roughly £550k with a £370k outstanding on the mortgage,
meaning we have £180k in equity. I constantly consider selling the house and going to live somewhere we can buy a house
for £180k. Possible candidates are Wales, Scotland, Cumbria, or a small Canadian mountain town. So what are the pros and
cons, why haven’t we done it already?

Pro: we could be FI in under a year! This is massive as we have a 4 month year old and we’d love to spend all our time
looking after them rather than going to pesky jobs.

Con: London has lots of jobs in our industry, the other places do not. Does that matter if we’re FI? Maybe so as we’d
both probably keep working part time as we enjoy our jobs and would like a large FI buffer. I (the frugalist) work
remotely so it would be fine for me, but not for the minimalist who needs to be in London. We also want the option to
work less until our children are at school. Living in London means we can quit jobs and find new ones at any time if
say we don’t like having our children in nursery.

Pro: We love the outdoors and want to live in an area where we can go hiking, skiing, sailing, and cycling in the
countryside without having to drive or take a train. To do any of our preferred hobbies right now it takes a few hours
to get there. We believe having this on our doorstep would greatly improve our happiness.

Con: We like our home and that it is slowly becoming ours. The £20k expense is £12k capital repayment and £8k interest
so we don’t really see it as a £20k annual expense as at some point we’ll not have a mortgage or sell and use the
equity to fund renting or a cheaper home. It is easy to leave London and move somewhere cheaper, it is harder to move
back. Becoming FI with this expense means that at some point in our retirement our expenses will halve, that's a lot of
extra capital to do exciting things with or just a nice safety net.

Moving to a different part of the world is one of the most effective ways to become FI but it is a huge step which we
don’t want to rush into. Would you move to a different part of the world? Let us know.
