We’re planning on declaring our selves financially independent once we have 30 times our annual expenses invested in
index funds. Wonder where 30 came from? I recommend reading [Beyond the 4%
rule](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1985721643/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1985721643&linkCode=as2&tag=fruminalism-21&linkId=ae4f5d32748381284213b5334130ed99).

Here are our expenses (monthly):

| Category   |      Amount      |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Mortgage |  1600 |
| House bills |    425   |
| Day to day | 500 |
| Holidays | 300 |
| Groceries | 200 |
| Private medical | 165 |
| Private medical | 165 |
| Baby fund | 50 |
| Home maintenance | 35 |

Day to day is our combined travel, eating out, buying gifts, clothes etc. Many months we come under
this but this is our maximum.

The baby fund is how much we spend on our 5
month year old. Most of the time we don’t spend this  as so far we have found having a child to be nearly free so it
goes into a savings account and eventually into their ISA. 

The holiday budget goes into a savings pot that we use year
round.

All of this sums up to about £40k a year, £20k of which is the mortgage which has 26 years left on it. We could pay it
down but it has a low interest rate so we choose to invest instead. 

From that we have three interesting FI totals:
* With the mortgage: £1.2m
* Without the mortgage: £600k
* Replacing mortgage with £600 a month rent in a cheaper area: £816k

By far our largest expense is the mortgage which we took out before we had discovered FI and we debate getting rid of it
at least once a month. I like to keep the other two FI numbers as by far the fastest way we could become FI is to move to a
cheap house in a cheaper area. I also like to highlight that renting for us would be a quicker path to FI.

How does your budget compare? What do you think we spend too much or too little on? Drop us an email.
