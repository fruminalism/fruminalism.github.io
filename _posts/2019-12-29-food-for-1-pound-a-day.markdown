Our food bill is already quite low. We mainly eat vegetarian at home. We’re recovering Waitrose/Ocado consumers and we now shop in LIdl/Aldi for what often seems higher quality but at a fraction of the price. We prefer to eat in than eat out and we’re quite happy batch cooking. We budget £200 a month for groceries (two adults and one baby) and that includes all cleaning products, healthcare products, baby related things (nappies, wipes, etc), and feeding our pets. 

However in January we’re going to kick it up a notch. We’re going to live off £62. How did we get to that number? We started with the [breadline challenge](https://www.greenhousepr.co.uk/foodcycle-the-breadline-challenge-uk-food-poverty/) of £2.10 a day. For two of us that would be 2 * 31 * 2.10 = £130. This did not seem like a challenge so £1 a day per person was set as the target! We’ll use some spices and store supplies we already have but even if we factored those in we’d be below the £2.10 a day each from the breadline challenge. 

So what will we eat? Pretty much what we normally do but we plan to eradicate any waste and meal plan so there aren’t any unexpected meals out or unplanned visits to the shops. We’ll be having:
* At least 2 pieces of fruit a day
* At least 3 portions of veg every day 

With the following kinds of meals:
* Porridge/homemade muesli/toast
* Spicy vegetable and bean stew
* Veg/rice stir fries
* Butternut squash risotto
* Pumpkin soup
* Mixed vegetable soup
* ...We’ll fill in more at the end of the month

Why do this? Not just to save money, but that’ll be nice. It is a reminder to how privileged and lucky we are to live in an age where food is so cheap and plentiful. Minimum wage in the UK is £8.21. Meaning that in 9 minutes you can earn enough to feed yourself for the day if you’re willing to cook it all at home, that’s amazing. Imagine how long it would take to tend your own crops to feed yourself? More than 9 minutes!
