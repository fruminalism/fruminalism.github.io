I am about 10 months into my FI journey and by far the biggest benefit has been my new found love of frugality and
minimalism. Before I analysed my expenditure and worked out where my money was really going I hadn’t realised how much
of a consumer I was and how unhappy a house full of pointless possessions made me.

Everytime I had a brief desire for something I’d click that amazon prime button and it would appear. Anytime I was out,
without realising it, I’d let advertising get to me and I’d purchase pointless things.

This all resulted in a house full of crap that needed sorting and tidying. Since starting my journal to FI I’ve gifted,
sold or thrown out over half my possessions and I couldn’t be happier. When I look at a room in my house now it only
contains the things I use and enjoy looking at. When I am out I am never tempted to buy anything, not having the desire
is a wonderful feeling.

I started being more frugal to increase my savings rate get to FI but now I love being frugal in isolation. I wouldn’t
spend more money even if it had an expiry date. Somewhere along the journey I realised I had the same passion for
minimalism. Having a small number of possessions, all of which bring value to my life, has made me a much happier
person.
