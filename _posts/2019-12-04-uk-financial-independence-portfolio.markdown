I am a lazy investor, but not lazy enough to pay 0.22% in fees.
My ideal portfolio is a global stock index, with a weighting towards the UK and US.
The UK, as I want to extract my funds in GBP and want to avoid currency risk. 
For the US, as it is the capitalist centre of the world. 


This portfolio is available in the UK in a single fund: Vanguard Lifestyle 100. 
However it comes at a price, and that is a 0.22% annual management charge.

You can see the make up of this fund:

|Fund                                                        |   %     |  Fee   | 
-------------------------------------------------------------|:-------:|:-------|
|Vanguard FTSE U.K. All Share Index Unit Trust               | 19.52%  |  0.06% |
|Vanguard U.S Equity Index                                   | 19.30%  |  0.10% |
|Vanguard FTSE Developed World ex-U.K Equity Index           | 19.25%  |  0.14% |
|Vanguard ETFs S&P 500 UCTIS ETF (Dist.) (USD) Distributing  | 13.14%  |  0.07% |
|Vanguard FTSE Developed Europe ex-U.K Equity Index          |  8.21%  |  0.12% |
|Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index                       |  7.98%  |  0.27% |
|Vanguard ETFs FTSE 100 UCITS ETF (Dist.) (GBP) Distributing |  4.78%  |  0.09% |
|Vanguard Japan Stock Index                                  |  4.67%  |  0.16% |
|Vanguard Pacific ex-Japan Stock Index -                     |  2.25%  |  0.16% |
|Vanguard ETFs FTSE 250 UCITS ETF (Dist.) (GBP) Distributing |  0.89%  |  0.10% |

 I have gone to the effort of putting the fee of each of the fund that is in the fund. Only one is above  0.22%, the emerging markets fund, and you can find a cheaper emerging markets fund from other providers, e.g. iShares. 

 So what I do is manage nearly the same portfolio but buy the funds and rebalance it my self, mainly done via monthly purchases as I am still accumulating my FI pot. 

 But remember I am lazy and that is too many funds. Who needs S&P 500 and S&P All share? Same for FTSE All Share and FTSE 100 / 250. I simplified it to this:

| Fund                                        | %    |
----------------------------------------------|------|
|S&P All Share Index                          | 35%  |
|FTSE All Share Index                         | 25%  |
|FTSE DEVELOPED WORLD EX-UK EQUITY INDEX      | 20%  |
|FTSE Developed Europe ex-U.K. Equity Index   |  8%  |
|FTSE Emerging Markets Index                  |  8%  |
|FTSE Pacific ex Japan                        |  2%  |
|Japan                                        |  2%  |

 This works out much cheaper, I also don't use Vanguard as a platform so I have access to cheaper funds for many of the indexes.
