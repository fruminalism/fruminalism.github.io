Would you take out a bank loan to buy a TV? I am guessing no, and if you would then stop being a doofus. Living beyond
your means is a sure-fire way of working until you die.

Yet Apple has convinced half the country to take out a loan to buy a new phone, worth over 1k, every 11 months. What on
earth is wrong with people?

Add on a contract for some data and minutes and people are spending 50-100 a month on a computer that turns them into a
zombie. A 100 pound a month expenditure for life is going to require an additional 40 THOUSAND pounds in your retirement
fund assuming a 3% withdrawal rate. Still think it is a good deal?

Here are some of the stupid excuses I’ve heard:

It is the computer I use the most so it is worth it. Well it shouldn’t be the computer you use the most, start talking
to people or read a book instead.

It is interest-free so it is free debt. Bollocks. If you save up in advance you’re getting interest while you save up
the full sum. Also you’ll probably appreciate how hard it is to save up the money so you don’t be stupid enough to spend
it on a phone. If you can’t afford to buy things in full you should save up and wait until you can afford them.

I am not against iPhones. In my experience they last for years and if you buy a model from a few years ago are much
better value. Don’t let Apple trick you into taking on debt and upgrading pointlessly to show you’re the best consumer.
