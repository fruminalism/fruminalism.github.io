title:  "Working backwards to FI"

I plan our financial independence differently to how other people do. Rather than saving up a certain sized pot of money, I work backwards from death until the present day, making sure each part of my life will be fully funded.

One of the reasons I want to be FI at an early age is I work in an industry known for age discrimination. At the moment I am
fortunate enough to have my pick of jobs for a decent salary, but I know as I grow older I’ll find it
harder and harder to find work.

Here are the important ages in the UK:

* 68: State pension
* 60: Lifetime ISA
* 57: SIPP: take 25% tax-free and pay an income via drawdown from the rest.

with taxable savings and ISAs being available at any time.

My first goal is to fill my LISA each year, knowing that with reasonable returns, I should have about 250k available by the time I am 60. This will easily last me for 8 years until I get my state pension at 68.

My next goal is to put enough in my SIPP to fund my life from 57. I like to plan pessimistically so I actually pretend the state pension doesn't exist, so I want my SIPP to fully cover my expenses.  By 57 I am sure I’ll struggle to get a job in my industry so I don’t want to be in a position where I can’t retire as soon as I get my SIPP.

Lastly come the ISAs. You can extract from an ISA whenever you like so once I have enough money in ISAs and other taxable
accounts to get me to 57 then I know I am good for life.

Another reason that I like to think about becoming FI this way is that if I abandon all frugality and FI-saving at any
point (heven forbid!), the worst-case scenario is that I end up with an amazing pension as I've front-loaded it.
