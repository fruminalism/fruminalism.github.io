title:  "Working backwards to FI"

I look at becoming financially independent quite differently to the norm. Rather than saving up to a certain size of pot
I am working back from death until the present day, making sure each part of my life will be fully funded.

One of the reasons I want to be FI at an early age is I work in an industry that is ripe with age discrimination. I am
fortunate enough at the moment to have my pick of jobs for a very good salary, but I know as I grow older I’ll find it
harder and harder to find jobs.

Here are the important ages in the UK:

* 68: State pension
* 60: Lifetime ISA
* 57: SIPP: take 25% tax-free and pay an income via drawdown from the rest.

With taxable and ISAs being available at any time.

My first goal is to fill my LISA each year, knowing that with reasonable returns, I should have about 250k available.
This will easily last me until I get my state pension at 68.

Next goal is to put enough in my SIPP to fund my life from 57. As I like to keep it safe I actually want enough in my
SIPP to fund me even if I never get the state pension. By 57 I am sure I’ll struggle to get a job in my industry so I
don’t want to be in a position I can’t retire as soon as I get my SIPP.

Then comes the ISAs, you can extract from an ISA whenever you like so once I have enough money in ISAs and other taxable
accounts to get me to 57 then I know I am good for life.

Another reason that I like to think about becoming FI this way is that if I abandon all frugality and FI saving at any
point, the worst-case scenario I end up with an amazing pension as I’ve front-loaded it.
