A Lifetime ISA allows you to save money that you can access once you are 60. The perk is that you get a 25% government
bonus! This makes up, somewhat, for the tax that you have paid. Forgetting about national insurance, UK Tax currently
stands at 20% up to 50k and 40% above so if you’re a lower rate taxpayer this is a good deal.

Pensions allow you to defer all the tax via salary sacrifice where you never pay the tax. If you aren’t using salary
sacrifice your lower rate tax gets relief directly in the pension, the higher rate tax back you claim back via your tax
return.

The key for pensions is the tax is only deferred. The hope being, for me at least, that your effective tax rate in
retirement will be lower as your expenses will be lower.
To work out if pensions or LISA is better for your circumstances you must estimate your tax rate out of your SIPP. The
considerations are:

* 25% lump sum tax-free withdrawal
* How much you expect to extract per year
* State pension and other taxable income


I’ll work in today’s allowances assuming they’ll move up with inflation. At age 57 I intend do take the full 25% and
then draw 24k a year until I get my state pension. Then I plan to reduce the amount by whatever state pension is when
I’m 68. Out of this 24k, 12.5k will be tax-free and 11.5k will be taxed at 20%. This is roughly a 10% tax rate and for
my pension pot as a whole it’ll work out lower due to the 25% lump sum.

So do LISAs make any sense for retirement income? Here’s why I still have one:

* You can put 40k a year into a pension after that fill up the LISA.
* Pension legislation changes dramatically. It is a political football. Will the 25% still exist when I retire? Will the
  lifetime allowance be dropped significantly? For these reasons, I don’t want too much in a pension.  
* The most likely change to LISA legislation is the bonus for new contributions and new accounts will go away, I can’t
  foresee anything drastic happening for the money already in a LISA.


Due to the potential legislation changes, I like filling my LISA. The order I do it is:

* Pension allowance for income in higher rate tax
* LISA
* Any remaining pension allowance that would be subject to lower rate tax
* ISA
* Taxable account
