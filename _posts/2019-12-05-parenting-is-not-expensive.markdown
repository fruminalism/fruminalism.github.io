Like many people trying to achieve financial independence one of my main motivations is to spend less time working and
more time with my family. I discovered FI while my wife was pregnant and being a present father is a huge motivation for
me. Have a search around the Internet and you’ll see some eye-watering figures for how much a child can cost, in the UK
I read that on average during pregnancy and the baby’s first-year parents spend on average £5000!

Our young one is now 4 months old and we’ve spent less than £100, how have we done it?

First, let’s start with the things we don’t have:
* A cot! we got a free baby box from Lid
* Any day time sleeping items such as Moses baskets, he sleeps on the floor
* A pram! Yes, you heard me, we carry our baby and it is the best decision we’ve ever made, he gets great sleep, we don’t
  need to push a thing the size of a shopping trolley everywhere and we certainly didn’t blow £800 on a “travel system”
* Any new clothes, we got all our clothes for ~£20 at a second-hand baby sale, we’ll need to stock up again at 9 months

Here are some things we use very little of:

* Nappies, google elimination communication (EC). The ones we use are from Lidl and a fraction of the price of branded
  ones
* Baby wipes, again EC, as well as good old cold water
* Toys are either second hand of gifts, if you go and talk to local parents they will be all too happy to get rid of their
  surplus

We did receive a carrier as a present which would have cost us about £120.

Bear in mind that in the UK if you earn less than £50k a year you get £80 a month child benefit so from what I can tell
so far having a child is a great side hustle.
